This python project reads your food diary and shows correlations between what you eat and how you feel.

I hope this helps to find some food intolerances.

Step by Step
=============

1. Write your food diary into `diary.txt`, including what you eat and how you feel
2. Define categories and synonyms in `ingredients.txt` 
3. use python to run `start.py`

This will output a graph for each ingregient (or ingredient category),
each with how you felt in the days after the consumption.
